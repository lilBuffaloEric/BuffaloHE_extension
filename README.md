# BuffaloHE_extension
An personal extension of Lattigo library. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


Built based on library Lattigo, this extension aims to construct more complex and interesting homomorphic functions using api
provided by Lattigo and other library. The extension is now still being developed, and is expected to contain functionality such
as (but not limited to): Evaluation of non-polynomial function inverse square root and softmax, remote sampling on cloud server, Matrix 
multiplication for different shapes, and shallow neural network training routine.
