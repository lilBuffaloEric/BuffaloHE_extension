# Specification

This directory is only for storing packages containing a set of useful functions that can be invoked by "main" packages in "main_pkgs" directory. 

If one wishes to create a new function, one should first look at the folders in this directory, and see if these folders have already contained some functions that satisfy his/her requirement. If not, one should either create new functions in a existing folder or a new folder. This depends on the purpose of the new functions. Functions with similar purposes should ALWAYS be stored in the same folder (and in the same package)!!!!
