# Specification
This directory is only for storing folders with packages named "main"!!!
If one need to create a new executable "main" package, one must first create a new folder in this directory (and name it properly so as to let us know what it is for), then create his/her "main" package in the newly created folder. 

WARNING: No ".go" file should be found directly in this directory!!! They should all be stored in some sub-folder/directory !!!

WARNING: "main" packages should be kept as short as possible. One shouldn't write all his/her codes in "main" packages. Instead, one should create functions in the "src_pkgs" directory, and invoke them in a "main" package !!!

Good luck to all :D
